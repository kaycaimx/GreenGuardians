## Project Description - Forest Vegetation Identification in British Columbia: A Static Algorithm Approach
- **Background**  
  Approximately 57% of British Columbia (BC) is forested, and while deep learning is effective for forest identification, it can be energy-intensive and unsustainable.

- **Goal**  
  The goal of this project is to develop an efficient and eco-friendly forest identification tool to enhance forest management and conservation, and to maintain ecosystem health in BC.

- **Research Objective**  
  The research objective is to utilize Sentinel-2 satellite data and various image processing algorithms through a static algorithm approach to identify forest vegetation in BC, evaluating the performance of different methods in forest identification.

- **Data Source**  
  The data sources for the project include Sentinel-2 L2A satellite imagery (e.g., sample images from the Pitt Meadows area) and Canada's Annual Forest Land Cover data to ensure detection results align with ground truth.

## Folders description
- **Ground Truth**
This folder contains land cover data files used as ground truth in our forest vegetation identification project. These TIFF files are crucial for validating the accuracy of our satellite image processing algorithms.

- **Notebooks**:
This folder houses all Jupyter notebooks used in our project. These notebooks include scripts for data retrieval, preprocessing, satellite image analysis, and algorithm application for forest vegetation identification. Each notebook is specifically named to reflect its purpose, such as downloading satellite data, identifying specific geographic locations, or applying Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) analysis.
